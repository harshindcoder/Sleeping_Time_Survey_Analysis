# Sleeping_time_analysis
## Overview
This analysis explores how lifestyle factors influence sleep patterns using a dataset that includes variables such as age, meals/day, physical illness, screen time, blue light filter usage, smoking/drinking habits, gender, exercise routines, beverages consumed, sleep direction, and sleep time.

Research shows that adults need at least seven hours of sleep for optimal health. Insufficient sleep is linked to cognitive decline, heart disease, and diabetes. Factors like screen time, alcohol consumption, and exercise routines directly impact sleep quality. Exposure to blue light disrupts the circadian rhythm, and exercise can improve sleep quality, while alcohol consumption delays sleep onset. Additionally, sleep direction, based on Vaastu Shastra, suggests that lying with the head pointed southward can positively affect sleep patterns.

By analyzing this data, we aim to identify key lifestyle patterns that affect sleep duration and quality, providing actionable insights to improve health and well-being.
